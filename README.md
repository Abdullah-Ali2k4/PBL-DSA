# Eclipse Data Management

## Overview
This project manages solar and lunar eclipse data using Java data structures. It utilizes a stack to store lunar eclipse data (eclipse date, time, and penumbral magnitude) with the most recent eclipses on top, and a queue to store solar eclipse data (eclipse date, time, and magnitude) in order, with the most recent data at the end of the queue.

## Features
- **Lunar Eclipse Stack**: Stores eclipse data with easy access to the most recent entries.
- **Solar Eclipse Queue**: Maintains solar eclipse data in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order.
- **Data Analysis**: Provides methods to count eclipses and identify top eclipses by magnitude.
  
## Data Structures
- **Stack**: Used for managing lunar eclipse data.
- **Queue**: Used for managing solar eclipse data.

## Problems Addressed
1. Count the total solar and lunar eclipses in the year 1995.
2. Find the top 3 solar eclipses among all years in terms of magnitude.
3. Count daytime solar eclipses from the year 1995 to 2000 (from 8 AM to 6 PM).

### Postulates
- **Postulate 1**: Are most solar eclipses occurring during daytime (from 8 AM to 6 PM)?
- **Postulate 2**: Are most lunar eclipses occurring during nighttime (from 6 PM to 8 AM)?
